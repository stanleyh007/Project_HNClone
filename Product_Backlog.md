Required features:
1. Story functionality
As this makes up the primary function of the clone and hacker-news itself, it is important that we can not only read a story, but post one to the site, whether that posting function is something that users can do, or that it's a call from another system that the teacher makes us do.
2. Login functionality
As a part of the hacker-news functionality that we have to clone, a user needs to be able to login, so that they may vote and potentially post a story of their own.
3. Sustainability
Since we have to make sure the system keeps functioning even after we turn in our project, we need to make sure that it's fully sustainable even when we're not focusing on it, that way it can stay up until christmas.
4. Presentable design
Despite the fact that we're mostly focusing on the actual functionality of the product, we still need it to look somewhat presentable instead of just looking like a white page with a bunch of links in a straight line.
5. List functionality
Given that hacker-news functions as a sort of proto-reddit, it's best that we find a way to show all the stories' headlines in a hub, much like the site itself, but only after making sure we can compute a single story on its proper page
6. Voting functionality
Given that stories on hacker-news can be voted on, so should the stories on our clone. We can decide if we want to limit user functionality in this area later, we need to make sure it works first of all.
